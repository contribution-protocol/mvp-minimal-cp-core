# mvp-minimal-cp-core
A structural MVP defining the minimal economic core of the Contribution Protocol.


## Assumptions

This structural MVP assumes:
- actions are meaningful only at higher layers
- time is provided by the execution environment
- no semantic guarantees are made at this layer

## Note
This repository is a structural MVP created to verify whether
expiration by time can be enforced without human judgment.

It is not a full implementation of the Contribution Protocol.
