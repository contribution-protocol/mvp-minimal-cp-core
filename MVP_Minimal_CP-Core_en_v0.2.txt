MVP_Minimal_CP-Core_en_v0.2



1. Purpose -------------------

This Structural MVP is designed to test whether a minimal economic core—
in which actions are accepted as institutional inputs, value is generated,
and value expires over time—can function without any central authority.

This MVP does not aim to provide a UI or business-oriented features.
It implements only an irreversible flow:

Action → Record → Issuance (mint) → Expiration

Components such as CRM, evaluation mechanisms, transfers, and smart contracts
are intentionally excluded.
Only the structure that proves viable in this MVP will serve as the foundation
for future extensions.

This MVP is a minimal implementation for verification purposes,
intended to confirm whether the institutional structure itself
can complete a full cycle in the real world without breaking.



2. Features -------------------

･ Record actions as institutional inputs
･ Issue value based on recorded actions (mint)
･ Automatically expire issued value over time (expiration)

4. Screen Flow -------------------

･ Action registration form
　- User selection or name input
　- Action title input
　- Submit button (POST)

･ Action list view
　- user_name
　- title
　- action_date
  - created_at
    Displayed as a list (GET)
