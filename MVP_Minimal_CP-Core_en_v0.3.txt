MVP_Minimal_CP-Core_ja_v0.3



1. Purpose -------------------

This MVP is designed to test whether a minimal economic core—
in which actions are accepted as institutional inputs, value is generated,
and value expires over time—can function without any central authority.

This MVP does not aim to provide a UI or business-oriented features.
It implements only an irreversible flow:

Action → Record → Issuance (mint) → Expiration

Components such as CRM, evaluation mechanisms, transfers, and smart contracts
are intentionally excluded.
Only the structure that proves viable in this MVP will serve as the foundation
for future extensions.

This MVP is a minimal implementation for verification purposes,
intended to confirm whether the institutional structure itself
can complete a full cycle in the real world without breaking.



2. Features -------------------

- Record actions as institutional inputs
- Issue value based on recorded actions (mint)
- Automatically expire issued value over time (expiration)



3. Expiration Definition -------------------

In this MVP, “expiration” does not mean physically deleting (burning) a token.

Once the `expires_at` timestamp is passed, a token enters a logically expired state, and the following constraints apply:

- Expired tokens cannot be used for any purpose
- Reactivation, reissuance, or reuse is not permitted
- Expired tokens are excluded from aggregation and system state calculations
- However, they are permanently retained in the database as system logs

Through this design, the MVP establishes an irreversible circulation boundary in which
records remain, but value does not return.


Note on Prestige -------------------

This MVP does not handle evaluations of actions (prestige) or trust scores.
These elements are higher-layer components that will be added after the core structure is confirmed to function correctly.
